ETASTEEE is a fun, experimental repository where creative coding meets a bruteforcer, educational environment. The project is designed to be a Roblox password bruteforcer, complete with colored outputs, ASCII art, and a retro, cinematic vibe inspired by classic hacker movies. This repository is purely for educational purposes hacking or unauthorized access is performed.

Features
Simulated Brute-Force Engine: Mimics a high-speed terminal attack with a visual display of password attempts represented by asterisks.

Customizable UI: Terminal interface with colorful menus and retro ASCII art that gives an authentic hacker look.

Discord Integration: Automatically sends the “cracked” password to a Discord webhook for display, adding an extra layer of interactivity.

Educational & Fun: Perfect for learning about Python scripting, terminal effects, and simulated cybersecurity—without any malicious intent.
